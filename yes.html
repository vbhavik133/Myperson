        <p>1st April 2023, the day when 1 first met you in real. I felt for you even before but that first meeting, that first sound of your voice in real, your first touch, your first smile on my silly joks, your first blush when 1 flirt with you,
        those butterflies  are still there when i see you everytime. 1 feel lucky to have you. You are so adorable and beautiful sometime i feel arey bhai yeh teri wife hai.. and 1 get smile with tears of joy in my eyes that, i got what i ever wished for.
